### Description
This is the midterm project for the DataTalks Club ML Zoomcamp 2024.

In this project we will build a web service that predicts house prices.

When we want to sell a house we visit a real estate site and provide all the house information we want to be available to a possible buyer. The problem arises when we want to find a suitable house price. What we usually do is we try to find other listed houses with similar characteristics and their prices. Most of the times this is a very time consuming procedure.

So to help a house seller find a house price more easily we are going to build a web service. When the user fills in all the house characteristics, those characteristics will be send to the web service which will actually be a model that will predict the house price and return it to the user.

This procedure will make the sellers experience easier and of course quicker.

### Dataset

We will use **Jiffs house price prediction** dataset from Kaggle. The dataset can be found in the URL below:

but you don't need to download it. It can be found in the **data** folder as **data.csv**
